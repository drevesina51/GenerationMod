Greetings. This project is a mod for the legendary OpenTTD game. 
Its main goals:
 1) Maintain functionality but improve script performance
 2) Extend script functionality into other 'post-map creation' initialization
 3) Adding the ability to change certain values when creating interconnected industries
 4) Increasing the realism of the generated map
 5) Creating an opportunity for the player to adapt the game to their standards and ideals
